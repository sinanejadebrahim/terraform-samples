This is a really good challenge to practice terraform
I've divided all files to make it easier to understand - you can put all of them in just a main.tf file
you'll work with docker images - building them and creating containers from them - using networks and volumes.
the site which is supposed to be shown may not be showing OK, cause i couldn't clone it completely - but it doesn't matter - the important thing is you being able to do terraform apply and have 3 containers running at the end.
there is also an image which shows a simple map of what we're doing.
